# Tabbed Upload Dialog - Implementation Verification Report

## Overview
Successfully implemented a tabbed interface in the `upload-reward-dialog-with-file.tsx` component that allows users to either upload new files or select existing files from Google Drive.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. New Imports Added ✅
- `Tabs`, `TabsList`, `TabsTrigger`, `TabsContent` from `@/components/ui/tabs`
- `GoogleDriveFilePicker` from `@/components/ui/google-drive-file-picker`
- `X` icon from `lucide-react` for clear selection button

### 2. Type Definitions Added ✅
- `GoogleDriveFile` interface with properties:
  - `id: string`
  - `name: string`
  - `mimeType: string`
  - `thumbnailLink?: string`
  - `size?: string`
  - `createdTime: string`
  - `webViewLink: string`

### 3. State Variables Added ✅
- `activeTab: 'upload' | 'select'` - tracks which tab is active (default: 'upload')
- `selectedDriveFile: GoogleDriveFile | null` - stores selected Google Drive file

### 4. Reset Logic Updated ✅
- `useEffect` hook now resets `activeTab` to 'upload' and `selectedDriveFile` to null when dialog opens
- Ensures clean state on each dialog open

### 5. Form Validation Enhanced ✅
- Upload mode: validates `mainFile` is selected
- Select mode: validates `selectedDriveFile` is selected
- Appropriate error messages for each mode

### 6. Conditional Upload Logic ✅
- **Upload Mode**: Uploads file to Google Drive via `/api/upload`
  - Handles main file upload
  - Handles optional thumbnail upload for videos
  - Auto-extracts thumbnail ID from Google Drive response
- **Select Mode**: Uses existing file ID directly
  - Skips upload API call
  - Extracts thumbnail ID from `thumbnailLink` if available
  - Sets progress appropriately

### 7. Tabbed Interface Implemented ✅
- `Tabs` component with controlled `activeTab` state
- `TabsList` with two equal-width triggers:
  - "Upload New" tab
  - "Choose Existing" tab
- `TabsContent` for upload mode:
  - Main file upload with `FileUpload` component
  - Optional thumbnail upload for videos
- `TabsContent` for select mode:
  - `GoogleDriveFilePicker` component
  - Selected file display with clear button
  - Shows file name, size, and media type

### 8. Dynamic UI Elements ✅
- **Dialog Title**:
  - Form step: "Add Reward"
  - Uploading step: "Uploading..." (upload mode) or "Processing..." (select mode)
  - Complete step: "Upload Complete!"
- **Dialog Description**:
  - Form step: "Upload a new file or choose an existing one from Google Drive"
  - Uploading step: Mode-specific messages
  - Complete step: "Your reward has been successfully created"
- **Submit Button**:
  - Text: "Upload Reward" (upload mode) or "Add Reward" (select mode)
  - Disabled when: loading, collections loading, or no file selected for active mode
- **Progress Display**:
  - "Uploading to Google Drive..." (upload mode)
  - "Creating reward..." (select mode)

### 9. Form Fields Placement ✅
- Name, Description, Rarity, and Collection fields remain outside tabs
- Always visible regardless of active tab
- Maintains consistent UX

## Next Steps
1. Manual testing in browser (checklist above)
2. Test with actual Google Drive authentication
3. Verify rewards are created correctly in database
4. Test across different browsers if needed
5. Consider adding E2E tests for critical paths

## Notes
- Implementation follows the provided plan verbatim
- All proposed changes have been applied successfully
- Code maintains backward compatibility
- Existing upload flow is preserved and enhanced, not replaced
