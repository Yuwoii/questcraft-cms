## üéâ Once Working

After successful sign-in and upload:
- Files appear directly in your Google Drive
- Optionally create a "QuestCraft Rewards" folder
- Set `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` in `.env.local` to upload to that folder
- Otherwise, files upload to root of your Drive

## üöÄ Next Steps

Once uploads work:
1. Create a "QuestCraft Rewards" folder in your Drive
2. Get folder ID from URL: `drive.google.com/drive/folders/FOLDER_ID`
3. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID="YOUR_FOLDER_ID"
   ```
4. All uploads will go to that folder!
